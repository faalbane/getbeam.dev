            <p>Welcome to Beam. These Terms of Service ("Terms") constitute a legally binding agreement between you ("User," "you," or "your") and NextUp Technologies ("Company," "we," "us," or "our"), governing your access to and use of the Beam desktop application and related services (collectively, the "Service").</p>
            <p>By downloading, installing, or using Beam, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, you must not download, install, or use Beam.</p>
            <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. Continued use of Beam after any such changes constitutes your acceptance of the revised Terms.</p>

            <!-- 2. Description of Service -->
            <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
            <p>Beam is a macOS desktop application that functions as a terminal emulator and organizer. It is designed to help developers manage multiple terminal sessions through workspaces, tabs, split panes, and saveable layouts.</p>
            <div class="highlight">
                <h3>Key Product Details</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Platform:</strong> macOS only. Beam requires macOS 13 (Ventura) or later.</li>
                    <li><strong>Desktop application:</strong> Beam runs entirely on your local machine. All terminal data, session content, and shell history remain on your device. Beam does not transmit, collect, or store your terminal content on any external server.</li>
                    <li><strong>Availability:</strong> Beam is offered in two tiers &mdash; a free tier and a paid Pro tier &mdash; as described in Section 4 below.</li>

            <h3>One License, One Device</h3>
            <p>Each Beam license is valid for use on <strong>one (1) device</strong> at a time. If you wish to use Beam on a different device, you may deactivate your license on the current device and reactivate it on the new device. Simultaneous use on multiple devices under a single license is not permitted.</p>
            <h3>Restrictions</h3>
